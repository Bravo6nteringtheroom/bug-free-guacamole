You guys when i was comparing the password entered with that soterd in the databse i encrypted the email instead of just inserting it as it is spended 2 hr to understand that i dont need to encrypt everything

Yo guys i hosted my website on my private network and every device connected to my network was able to use it

Oh my god so you saying instead of hashing the Login Password and comapre it with the hashed password stored in the database i could just use passwordverify() instead of all of that

Great now everytime i refresh the page the same values inside the sign in page are added to the database im not dealing with this its 11 pm im tired i'll do this tommorow

Still trying to understand the difference between sessions and cookies

Yo boys today finally after finishing my finals i got a break so now im back to work on the project trying to finsih it instead of making it a forgetable side project

So today i used Typescript to make sure that the signin input is correct and all good to be sum

oka guys im so tired now for today i just added the cookie feature to store the users email inside a cookie and use it somewhere else in the website the problem here is that using typescript to code and then compiling it to js code added the Object(...) something like that this problem right here is what stopping me from using the cookie feature hope i can solve it soon but for today i added the feature and this bug shall be solved just like the rest

haaah okay guys so for the cookie stuff i managed to create the cookie using js instead of using the typescript i realized that not all things should be done by Typescript or maybe its because i faced the same error of the import stuff where i was editing my package.json and tsconfig.json file for nothing so yeah i managed to create the cookie that store the email and its live now and it will be destroyed after a day or when the user logout

okay so bascially i had to change some stuff because i was trying to print the session in my php backend and all of that chaos was just because i forgot to type session_start() in the php code i want so yeah i was this close to destroying the first thing i saw in my house

okay so for todays prograss i managed to use the sessions and im planning on using them in future if the user want to go to a specific page that require an account so it checks if he already signed in or nah so he can create an account

oka guys so i can officaly say that my website contains cookies and session which both me destroyed when you log out of the website and get created when you sign in or login in to the website now finally turned out that the problem this whole time with the cookie was that i created a cookie named different then the cookie i wanna destroy it was hard but solving it was funny

And now i can officaly say that the website is done it was hard it was a big challenge i was tired but looking now at it i relaized that i started this website knowing nothing saying that i will learn while building this made me realize that the true way to learn is by building instead of watching i learned typescript i learned php authentication database connection and so on heck i even learned how to prevent the website from sql and xss i can say im proud of what i achived

AND NOW Since the website is done now for the next boss hosting it using apache by downloading ubuntu and using apache to host it ANd using docker containers since i dont know what it is but im sure ill figure it out
