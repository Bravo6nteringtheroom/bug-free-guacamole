You guys when i was comparing the password entered with that soterd in the databse i encrypted the email instead of just inserting it as it is spended 2 hr to understand that i dont need to encrypt everything

Yo guys i hosted my website on my private network and every device connected to my network was able to use it

Oh my god so you saying instead of hashing the Login Password and comapre it with the hashed password stored in the database i could just use passwordverify() instead of all of that

Great now everytime i refresh the page the same values inside the sign in page are added to the database im not dealing with this its 11 pm im tired i'll do this tommorow

Still trying to understand the difference between sessions and cookies

Yo boys today finally after finishing my finals i got a break so now im back to work on the project trying to finsih it instead of making it a forgetable side project

So today i used Typescript to make sure that the signin input is correct and all good to be sum
